# Collection of my articles in learning Artifical Intelligence

When I started to learn machine learning, data mining or other knowledge related with artifical intelligence, I found the books were difficult to understand because they were filled with mathematics, algorithms, programming languages that I did not know yet.

So I decided to write down what I read as well as my comprehension about those ideas in my way.

The reason that I name this book "AI for kids" just because I feel I were a kid when I try to learn those principles, equations, programs.

I hope I can grow up in such a field.
